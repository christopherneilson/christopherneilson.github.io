  desc: 'This research will use experimental methods to study the reasons parents make school choices with very little information about options available to them. The research will study the relative importance of two mechanisms through which this occurs: (i) difficulty and cost of acquiring information about school characteristics, and/or (ii) families have incorrect beliefs about the distribution of schools, believing that all schools are the same. The research will develop a theoretical model based on parent?s beliefs about school quality and how these beliefs change as they receive new information. The research will then test this theory by providing different amounts of information to parents to see how this affects their school choice decisions. The pilot
  study was conducted in 2017 and the first research paper is titled Search Costs, Biased Beliefs and School Choice under Endogenous Consideration Sets, coauthored with Adam Kapor, Claudia Allende and Patrick Agte.'

We will conduct this study in the context of the public school district in New Haven, Connecticut , which uses a centralized mechanism closely related to the “immediate acceptance” or “Boston” algorithm to administer school choice.'

A panel of in depth house hold surveys are conducted on a custom designed application measure time use, parental investments and labor supply decisions. Administrative data is used to evaluate the impact and survey data is used through the lens of a dynamic human capital accumulation model to study the mechanisms through which information on financial aid, returns to levels of education and to field of study can affect investment in human capital and labor supply.

  donor: Skills for Youth Program, J-PAL LAC
  date: 2018
  amount: 49479
  description: In this study, we collaborate with the government of the Dominican Republic to construct an information system and deploy a state of the art application that leverages innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the quality of the personalization of information provision. Labor market earnings information as well as detailed financial aid information and skills profiles by major will be provided through an application used by social workers who visit students who participate in the national conditional cash transfer program PROSOLI. Using the custom application, social workers will help the prospective student navigate the complex higher education landscape with prompts from the app, making sure to discuss how financial aid works in their specific case and how it can change depending what they choose to study and where.

  amount: 256893
  description: In this project we work together with the Ministry of Higher Education of the Dominican Republic to design and evaluate different aspects of their post-secondary financial aid policy. Guided by both theory and empirical evidence, we work with the government to design and implement several randomized control trials to evaluate different aspects of the financial aid policy, focusing on recruitment, selection and retainment of talented but underprivileged students in post secondary education. Estimates of these various margins will help inform the design of final version of constrained-optimal financial aid policy.

  description: "This is a collaborative project with the City government of Santo Domingo to design and evaluate different interventions to improve payment compliance for public garbage collection. In a first stage, we will analyze data on payment histories, as well as undertake targeted interviews and focus groups to gain a deeper understanding of the determinants of payment compliance. In the second stage, we will design and implement several randomized control trials to evaluate different behavioral and non-behavioral approaches to reduce free-riding. The interventions considered are: 1) Simplification of communication and payment instructions; 2) A lottery for households with timely payments; 3) Informing households about the consequences on their credit history of not paying the bill; 4) Informing households about debt relief options, 5) Informing citizens about actual compliance rates in high compliance neighborhoods. This will shed light on how to improve a state’s capacity to effectively collect payments for government services."
