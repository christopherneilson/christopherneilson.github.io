abstract: 'In many settings, market designers must contend with the presence of off-platform options which do not participate in the coordination of the designed portion of the market.
In this paper, we study the empirical relevance of the configuration of on- and off-platform  options in the context of centralized college-major choice and assignment.
We quantify significant negative externalities generated by off-platform options and measure the aftermarket frictions that contribute to generating them in practice.
Our empirical application uses administrative data from the centralized assignment system for higher education in Chile
and leverages a recent policy change that increased the number of on-platform slots by approximately 40\%.
We first present a policy analysis which shows that expanding the centralized platform leads students to start college sooner, are less likely to drop out, and are more likely to graduate within six years. We develop an empirical model of college applications, aftermarket waitlists, and matriculation choices.
We estimate the model using information from students' ranked-ordered applications and final enrollment choices on- and off-platform.
We use the estimated model to quantify welfare impacts, decompose different mechanisms and to conduct counterfactual excersizes.
We find that when more programs are available on the centralized platform, welfare increases substantially, especially for less advantaged students and for women.
These externalities are driven by students who receive and decline on-platform offers, and are amplified by substantial frictions in waitlists.
Our results indicate that expanding the scope of a higher education platform can have real impacts on welfare and human capital.
Importantly, the effects are larger for students from lower SES backgrounds, suggesting the design of platforms can have effects on both efficiency and equity. '
