abstract: "Family members and social connections are widely believed to influence important life decisions,
but identifying their causal effects is notoriously difficult. We present causal evidence
from Chile, Croatia, Sweden, and the United States that older siblings higher education trajectories
significantly influence the college and major choices of their younger siblings. Exploiting
admission cutoffs that generate quasi-random variation in older siblings higher education options,
we show that younger siblings tend to follow their older siblings paths. Older siblings
are followed regardless of whether their target and counterfactual options have large, small or
even negative differences in expected earnings, peer quality and retention rates. These spillover
effects disappear, however, if the older sibling drops out of college, suggesting that older siblings
experiences in college matter. Despite the many differences across these four countries, in
each case we find evidence that siblings influence important human capital investment decisions.
That siblings influence important human capital investment decisions across such varied contexts
suggests that our findings are not an artifact of particular institutional detail but instead
a more generalizable description of human behavior."
