abstract: 'A growing body of evidence shows that differences in firm-specific pay premiums account for a large share of the gender pay gap.  
This paper asks how a common form of pre-labor market skill specialization, college major, mediates access to high-paying firms, and what this means for the gender earnings gap.  
Using employer-employee tax data from Chile matched to educational records, we show that differences in college major account for more than two-thirds of the firm contribution to the gender earnings gap among college admits.  
Degrees in Technology, which are numerous, male-dominated, and associated with high firm premiums, drive these effects.'
