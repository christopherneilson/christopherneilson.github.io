abstract: "In this paper, we explore from a normative perspective the contours
of an optimal spending rule for a government that has volatile revenues
from an exogenous source such as a flow from a natural resource, very
much like Chile. Specifically, we analyze policies for a government
with a precautionary saving motive that decides how much to transfer
from volatile copper revenues to impatient agents that differ in their
private incomes, which in turn are volatile and correlated with fiscal
revenues. Much as in reality, the government can save abroad, has
limited space for borrowing against future revenue, and has access to
an imperfect technology for targeting transfers (that is, a portion of
transfers leaks to richer households). Householdsâ€™ behavior is simple:
they consume all available income.
Output is exogenous in our model, that is, fiscal multipliers are
zero, so any countercyclical action reflects the desire of increasing
transfers at times when household consumption is low and
government spending has a higher marginal utility, rather than a
Keynesian mechanism. Fiscal policy is ultimately the implementation
of social insurance. We analyze the welfare gains of an optimal rule
vis-a-vis a balanced-budget rule whereby the government transfers all its
revenues to households in each period. We also study the behavior
of government assets and the extent to which government spending
is countercyclical. We compare the optimal rule prescribed by our
model with simpler rules, including the Chilean SBR, a rule that
spends the permanent income from copper (a la Friedman), and
linear rules similar to the SBR except that propensities to consume
out of assets and structural revenues are chosen optimally. We also
analyze the gains from having an escape clause."
