abstract: 'A central point in the market design case for the use of strategyproof assignment mechanisms in school choice is that they relieve applicants of the need to strategize on the basis of beliefs about admissions chances. This paper shows that beliefs about admissions chances shape choice outcomes even when the assignment mechanism is strategyproof by influencing the way applicants search for schools, and that smart matching platforms providing live feedback on admissions chances help applicants search more effectively. Motivated by a model in which applicants engage in costly search for schools and over-optimism can lead to under-search, we use data from a large-scale survey of choice participants in Chile to show that learning about schools is hard, that beliefs about admissions chances guide the decision to stop searching, and that applicants systematically underestimate nonplacement risk. We then use RCT and RD research designs to evaluate live feedback policies at scale in the Chilean and New Haven choice systems. We find that 22 percent of applicants submitting applications where risks of nonplacement are high respond to warnings by adding schools to their list, reducing their nonplacement risk by 58 percent. These results replicate across settings and over time. We conclude that reducing the strategic burden of school choice requires not just strategyproofness inside the centralized system, but also choice supports for the strategic decisions that inevitably remain outside of it.'
