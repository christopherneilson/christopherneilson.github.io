abstract: "This note provides new evidence on how small business owners have been impacted by
COVID-19, and how these effects have evolved over time since the passage of the CARES Act.
As part of a broader and ongoing project, we collected survey data from more than 8,000 small
business owners in the U.S. from March 28th, one day after the CARES Act was passed, through
April 20th. The data include information on their firm size, layoffs, beliefs about the future
prospects of their businesses, as well as their awareness of existing government relief programs.
We provide three main findings. First, by the time the CARES Act was passed, surveyed
small business owners were already severely impacted by COVID-19-related disruptions, with
60% having laid of workers. Second, business ownersâ€™ expectations about the future are in
general negative and have continuously deteriorated throughout our study period, with 37%
of respondents in the first week reporting that they did not expect to recover within 2 years,
growing to 46% by the last week. Third, we show that the smallest businesses had the least
awareness of government assistance programs, the slowest growth in awareness after the passage
of the CARES Act, and never caught up with the larger businesses. The latter indicate that
small businesses may have missed out on initial Paycheck Protection Program funds because of
low baseline awareness and differential access to information relative to larger firms.
